\section{PhD thesis}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Annotation-Agnostic Differential Expression and Binding Analyses}.}
\cvitem{Advisors}{\textbf{Jeffrey T. Leek} and \textbf{Andrew E. Jaffe}.}
\cvitem{Description}{The goal was to develop statistical methods and software that enable researchers to differentiate the sources of variation observed in RNA-seq while minimizing the dependance on known annotation. This allows researchers to correct for technological variation and study the biological variation driving their phenotype of interest. We applied these methods to further our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders using the Lieber Institute for Brain Development human brains collection ($>$ 1000 samples).}
