\section{PhD thesis}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Annotation-Agnostic Differential Expression and Binding Analyses}.}
\cvitem{Advisors}{\textbf{Jeffrey T. Leek} and \textbf{Andrew E. Jaffe}.}
\cvitem{Description}{The goal is to develop statistical methods and software that enable researchers to differentiate the sources of variation observed in RNA-seq while minimizing the dependance on known annotation. This will allow researchers to correct for technological variation and study the biological variation driving their phenotype of interest. Then apply these methods to further our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders using the Lieber Institute for Brain Development human brains collection ($>$ 1000 samples).}
